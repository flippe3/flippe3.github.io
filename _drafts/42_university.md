# Introduction
In 2018, five days after I graduated high school I flew to Silicon Valley with my friend and spent the next 30 days going to 42 University. This will be a simple explanation (I was wrong) of what 42 University is and my opinions about it after passing the Piscine. I'm writing this four years after my visit to relive my memories there.

## What is 42 University?

## Getting an invite
Everything started off by my friend finding this website about a "University" in Silicon Valley that offered a one month coding bootcamp to try to get into the university. They offered free housing during these 30 days in San Fransisco. Immediately we read all the information we could find about the university online and even found a few videos of some videos published to youtube. To get a spot to go to the university you had to pass a logic puzzle. I remember going home and doing the logic puzzle and thinking about the genius idea of having such a fun but simple game as a test. Anyone could do it regardless of programming skill.

Afterwards we both got emails that we would be able to come to the university so we convinced our parents to let us go, to let us travel half the planet to write some code in the worlds most famous coding city. Thankfully our parents agreed to let us go probably because the pure excitement we had of wanting to travel there. 

So we took the little money we had saved up during high school and paid $500 each for plane tickets. Then we sat up at 3 AM. to watch the introductary information before flying there.

## The first day
I had visited New York and Florida three years prior to my visit in SV but the energy and the people in SV is quite different from the people in New York. Yet this time I was there with just one friend and got to experience what it was like to actually live in america for 30 days. 

It started off by us not finding the address to the student housing and we didn't want to turn on our GPS because of the worry of the pricy roaming fees we would have to pay. Eventually we made found it and were given a room to setup our bunk beds in, we probably shared about 16 m^2 between four guys. I got to room with my Swedish friend that I travelled there with, an Armenian that lived in LA (the self proclaimed natural born genius) and a Puerto Rican teacher. The bathroom was simple and since the housing had been devry universities dorms it wasn't in the best of qualities. I'd recommend flip flops in the shower, although I didn't have any.

## The People 
When we started at 42 everyone came from different places of the world, different experiences and very different skillsets. One of my good friends there was a lock smith that wanted to become a coder, some were CS students that wanted to get some coding experience and perhaps a way to find a job. Yet everyone was really nice and growing up in Sweden I would say that Swedes are quite introverted, we rarely talk to strangers and such and at 42 it was essential to talk to strangers. It was part of if not the most important lesson at 42, that with just a few friends and the web the information you can learn is unlimited. 

I can't and won't talk about all the brilliant people I met there but lets just say that everyone was really friendly and open to help anyone.
