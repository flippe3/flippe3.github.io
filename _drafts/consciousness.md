<!--I'm writing this post to try to understand more about consciousness and the mind. Whether or not the following text is my belief or just a thought experiment I have yet to decide.

This is clearly a philosophical field and not one that I'm experienced in, I've lived about 23 years on this planet and I've yet to understand the supercomputer I've been given, this is an attempt at understanding more of it.

Consciousness, the mind and thinking in general has of course been one of the greatest mysterious of mankind. Therefore there are many popular books, movies and people attempting to understand these mysteries. Here I summarize some thoughts on the subject and then give my own take.

## Critics of machines (consciousness believers)

### Roger Penrose
Roger Penrose is to my understanding a proponent to AI or atleast AGI, that AI will never be able to think like a human nor reach the intelligence levels of the human mind. He discusses this in his book [The Emperor's New Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind). Although I have wanted to read this book for a long time I have not found the time to do so as of yet. Although from looking at some of his conversations I take it that in this book he argues that human consciousness is non-algorithmic and that it can never be modeled by a conventional Turing machine. 

### Nick Lane


### Julian Jaynes
In [The Origin of onsciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind) Jaynes sums up consciousness as:
> At one time, human nature was split in two, an executive part called a god, and a follower part called a man. Neither part was consciously aware.

## Unclear 

### Richard Feynman
Feynman is a brilliant physicist and certainly one of the brightest minds of the previous generation. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipRvjS7q1DI) he makes a response to his belief on machine intelligence. This was recorded September 26th 1985, so for me this is very interesting, to see that he understood that while the machines of his time were quite limited compared to the time of writing this he still didn't want to predict something that machines wouldn't be able to do in the future. He never really mentions his thoughs on conciousness or any such philosophy but to me he seems to be of the thought that machines and human minds will be different but this is not of any great importance.

### Alan Turing
One of these great scientists is of course [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). And while [The Imitation Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/) is not a documentary, I have taken great inspiration from this movie and most certainly the scenes where Turing interacts with the police. The police poses the question "Can machines ever think like human beings do?". 

> Well the problem is you're asking a stupid question, of course machines can't think as people do. A machine is different from a person and hence they think differently. The interesting question is just because something thinks differently from you does that mean that it is not thinking?
We allow humans to have such divergencies from one another. You like strawberries, I hate ice skating, you cry at sad films, I'm allergic to pollen. What is the point of different tastes, different preferences if not to say that our brains work differently. That we think differently. And if we can say that about one another why can't we say that for brains built of copper and wire, steel.

## My thoughts

I find it difficult to summarize my thoughts about something as philosophical as the consciousness but I suppose that's the whole point of writing this. To me consciousness is a scape goat. It's a way for humans to say that we are superior to AI because we have this one thing that they can never have. I think our brain is absolutely amazing but to think that it has this mystical element to it that no machine can ever replicate is a delusion. Therefore consciousness is a scam.
