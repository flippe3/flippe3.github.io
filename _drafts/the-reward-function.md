The field of reinforcement learning is the part of machine learning that is perhaps most inspired by humans. The action we take in an environment to explore and try to understand how the world works, or at least how humans interact with an environment when we are children. The most vital part of reinforcement learning is the reward function, it guides the agent into improving. The reward function simply gives a positive reward when the agent has taken a good action and negative reward when the action was poor. 

One could argue that the question what is the human reward function is as philosophical as "what is the meaning of life". Yet this is not what this essay explores. I'd like to explore what is guiding us, is it as simple as dopamine or is there a deep confouding goal? If the reward function is dopamine then I find humanity quite a boring spicies. We maximize our dopamine and then we become a steady-state species that couldn't be seperated from a rock. Perhaps its a delusion in my thinking that I want us to have a real reward function, that creates meaning. 

If dopamine is the reward function then that would be an argument for the fermi paradox. We haven't seen any aliens, perhaps its not because there are none, or  perhaps more realistically they have just become a steady-state species pleasuring their dopamine. Of course you could argue that there is no other intelligent life out there but I find that highly irrational, we only have one proof of intelligence (our selves) and from what we understand about biology this seems complex but it is certainly not impossible. Then think back to the human species just say a mere 500 years back. I don't think any human today running around with a computer in their pocket wirelessly listening to their favorite artist would argue that we were intelligent back then. So the universe has created some kind of bacteria then intelligence seems to be just a matter of when, not if. 

The problem is that the human species has become obsessed with maximizing a couple digits on their bank account.
