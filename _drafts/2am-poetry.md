the computer is [my portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb_yvBNLjNk)\
the screen is my eyes\
the keyboard is my neurons

computers are like magic\
the best portal is one that creates an infinite playground\
the best portal is my computer

some people don't get to discover the world of computing\
some choose not to\
while the horizon created by X is beautiful\
my horizon is the blinking cursor in my terminal\
waiting for me to create the next thing

some people spend there whole life arguing about that X\
others dedicate their whole life to serving X\
but whats the point, the cursor never stops blinking\
god will never exist\
consciousness is just a hoax so that you can fall asleep at night\
we are all just a 12 year old aliens science lab
