I'm Filip Nilsson and I'm studying computer science at Lule√• University of Technlogy.

I'm very interested in machine learning. During 2022 I published two research papers in NLP at [ACL2022](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/) and [Fire2022](https://dl.acm.org/conference/fire). Currently 
I'm working on my master thesis on the topic of meta reinforcement learning.
